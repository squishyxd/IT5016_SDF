Repository as required for IT5016 Assessment 3
IT5016_SDF
Student ID: 20241484

This is my research repository for IT5016. It includes a mix of code I wrote myself, code I practiced with, and my thoughts on different programming ideas and design principles. I used what I’ve learned in class and added some extra notes to show how I’ve improved my understanding.

Coding_Concepts:
1. pythonProject_1.py
this is a file ive made that includes all the basics and small things we have learnt throughout this portion of the course purely to keep my documents and files in a nicer state by having most of the code I haven’t written all in one file. it also includes some found code that I used to learn from, from the W3Schools website.
•	Observer pattern notes
o	Talks about the observer pattern and how it works in programs like GUIs.
•	Modular design thoughts
o	Thoughts on why splitting code into smaller parts makes it easier to test and fix.
•	Input validation principles
o	Why it’s important to check input properly, and how it helps avoid errors.


My_Code:
I have created a folder that has code I made myself during the course. I added comments and made sure each part is easy to follow.
1. IT5014_Assessment 2_PartA_20241484.py
2. IT5014_Assessment 2_PartB_20241484.py
Most recent version of the code uploaded for assessment.
•	Has built-in error checking.
•	Automatically creates approval references.
•	Tracks how many requisitions and what their status is.
3. requistionsystemSAVED.py
A basic system to manage requisitions using functions and classes.
•	Uses modules to split up the code.
•	Includes input checks so users can’t leave things blank.
•	Shows good structure with separate sections for collecting info, calculating totals, and deciding approval.
4. requistionsystemUSERINPUT.py

Inspired_Code:
1.  Task 1 simon week 4.py
2.  help desk.py
3.  task2_Requistions_total.py
•	Modular Design: I broke down the code into smaller functions and sections.
•	Encapsulation: Used classes to keep data and methods together.
•	Input Validation: Checked that users can't leave fields empty.
•	Single Responsibility: Each function or method does one job.
•	Reusable Code: Functions can be used again in other programs.
•	Readable Code: Clear names, consistent layout, and helpful comments

Reflections
I would have prefered to know about the need for the Github repository earlier in the course. I found this really helpful and I would have like to save every file I worked on in here so that I could easily reflect back on my learning and refer back to the files. However, I started doing this later in the project hence why there are not that many files. Working on this repo helped me understand how to make better organise my coding files. It would allow me to see how my earlier work could be improved by using principles like modularity and better input checking. Writing comments and organizing things clearly made me think more about how other people (or my future self) would read and use my code.

Putting this all together showed me how much I’ve learned and also gave me a better idea of what I still want to improve. It was good to look back at my old work and make it better.
